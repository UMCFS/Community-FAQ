Current hours / closures can be found under the Calendar here: https://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/westmont.aspx

The morning raffle is up to each manager's discretion if they want to do the queue. Depends on stock and some are less willing to do it with the new Holiday Hours apparently. If it is being done, queue will open 1 hour before the store for truck/stock days.

The store's number is listed on the BBB website as (630) 371-5500

**Standard Shipment Dates at Westmont’s Micro Center are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.** There are trucks that come in on non standard days, but this is completely unpredictable.

**Section Rules:**
- Follow all server rules
- As a reminder, scalping is prohibited by the rules of this server. Don't be that person.
- Live stock updates from those at the store belong in #📦-il-wmt-stock-alerts. Do not post questions in the alerts channel.
- Live line updates and chatting for those in line goes in #🧑-il-wmt-store-chat.
- Questions belong in #💬-il-wmt-general-chat. If your message was deleted from the updates channel, try again in chat
- Again, the updates channel is for confirmed quantities of what is currently in stock, at the Westmont Micro Center. **Do not post "how's the line," or "what's the stock," or "update?," or "price check?" or any variation of that in the updates channel.**
- If posting a picture into the stock channel, you must include a description of what the picture depicts.

**GPU Stock:**
- Westmont has a once per 30 day limit on GPU purchases
- 30-day limit applies to any purchase of any card and is chain wide. They will check your ID and if you have bought ANY card at ANY MC in the last 30 days you will not be allowed to purchase a card
- The website does have prices listed but stock quantities are not representative of what's in store.
- Loitering in the store, particularly the BYO section waiting for graphics cards, will get you the boot. Folks should not be clogging up the pipes for the stores. Keep to the lines if you're waiting for cards, and go home when they're not there.
- All in stock Nvidia 30-Series GPUs are LHR cards,  except the 3090.

**CPU Stock:**
Ryzen 5000 CPUs are mostly available at the store.

**Line:**
With the lottery QR code being implemented, lines and camping have been all but eliminated. **Posting or sharing the link or QR code is a bannable offense. Don't do it.** Don't ask others to.

**Mid-Day Drops:**
MC Westmont has shown a pattern of dropping "mid day" restocks on “truck days”. 
- If and when they happen, they tend to be around 1-3pm. 
- There are no known "mid-day" shipment days at this time
- Loitering in the store, particularly the BYO section waiting for graphics cards, will get you the boot. Folks should not be clogging up the pipes for the stores. Keep to the lines if you're waiting for cards, and go home when they're not there.

**Misc:**
- Your questions/answers for "any ideas on shipment" are completely superstitious until a list is posted (has never happened in Chicago), those doors open, or an employee tells the line otherwise.
- This server is amazing for a lot of things, and we try to be helpful, but you need to do your own leg work (that's just good etiquette). If you're asking for help, at least be willing to look up simple things (Product MSRP, Store hours, etc) on your own.
- If you post "No Stock," or any variation thereof in #📦-il-wmt-stock-alerts, please include a photo or video (when able).

**Server Staff:**
IL staff is @daedalus01#0001 and @Michowski#4888. If there are immediate issues with the server, feel free to ping one of us, if we are online. 
- If we are offline/idle, or you would like a more discreet way to report please message @ModMail#5460 for online server staff to come in and help. 
- We are not employees of Micro Center, and we are volunteers.
- Please don't direct message server staff directly unless absolutely necessary.
