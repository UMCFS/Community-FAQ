**Standard Shipment Dates at Chicago's Micro Center are Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.** There are trucks that come in on non standard days, but this is completely unpredictable.

**Section Rules:**
- Follow all server rules
- As a reminder, scalping is prohibited by the rules of this server. Don't be that person.
- Live stock updates from those at the store belong in #üì¶-il-chi-stock-alerts. **Do not post questions in the alerts channel.**
- Live line updates and chatting for those in line goes in #üßë-il-chi-store-chat 
- Questions belong in #üí¨-il-chi-general-chat. If your message was deleted from the updates channel, try again in chat
- Again, the updates channel is for confirmed quantities of what is currently in stock, at the Chicago Micro Center. **Do not post "how's the line," or "what's the stock," or "update?," or "price check?" or any variation of that in the updates channel.**
- If posting a picture into the stock channel, you must include a description of what the picture depicts.

**GPU Stock:**
- GPUs are mostly available at the store.
- The website does have prices listed but stock quantities are not representative of what's in store.
- Loitering in the store, particularly the BYO section waiting for graphics cards, will get you the boot. Folks should not be clogging up the pipes for the stores. Keep to the lines if you're waiting for cards, and go home when they're not there.
- All in stock Nvidia 30-Series GPUs are LHR cards, except the 3090 and 3090Ti.

**CPU Stock:**
Ryzen 5000 CPUs are mostly available at the store.

**Line:**
Lines are gone and QR code raffles are eliminated.

**Mid-Day Drops:**
MC Chicago has now shown a pattern of dropping "mid day" restocks on ‚Äútruck days‚Äù. 
- If and when they happen, they tend to be around 1-3pm. 
- There are no known "mid-day" shipment days at this time.
- Loitering in the store, particularly the BYO section waiting for graphics cards, will get you the boot. Folks should not be clogging up the pipes for the stores. Keep to the lines if you're waiting for cards, and go home when they're not there.

**Misc:**
- Your questions/answers for "any ideas on shipment" are completely superstitious until a list is posted (has never happened in Chicago), those doors open, or an employee tells the line otherwise.
- This server is amazing for a lot of things, and we try to be helpful, but you need to do your own leg work (that's just good etiquette). If you're asking for help, at least be willing to look up simple things (Product MSRP, Store hours, etc) on your own.
- If you post "No Stock," or any variation thereof in #üì¶-il-chi-stock-alerts, please include a photo or video (when able).
